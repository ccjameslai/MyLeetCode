### **Two Sum (1)**

### **Replace All ?'s to Avoid Consecutive Repeating Characters (1576)**

1. Check the first char. If it is a question mark and the next char is also a question mark, directly assign to 'a'. 

2. If the next char is not a question mark, replace the first char not the same as the next.

3. Do the similiar thing at step 1 and 2. However, there is a little different thing at step 2. It not only checks the next char, but also the previous.
